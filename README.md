🗣️ Hate Speech Detection
This is a machine learning project that detects whether a given text contains hate speech, offensive language, or is clean.
It uses Python and Jupyter Notebook to walk through the entire process step-by-step.

📂 What’s in the Dataset?
The dataset contains text data from social media, labeled as:

Hate Speech – Content targeting people based on race, religion, gender, etc.

Offensive Language – Insults, swearing, or offensive terms

Clean – Neutral and safe content

Each row has:

Tweet/Text – The actual content

Label – Category (Hate Speech, Offensive, or Clean)

🔍 What the Project Does
Loads and explores the dataset

Cleans the text (removing stopwords, punctuation, etc.)

Converts text into numerical form using techniques like TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer

Trains machine learning models for classification

Evaluates model accuracy and performance

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
Python

pandas, numpy – For handling data

matplotlib, seaborn – For visualizations

scikit-learn – For machine learning

nltk – For text preprocessing

📊 What You’ll Get
Insights about hate speech trends in the dataset

Model accuracy results

Examples of predictions on new text
