🫀 Heart Failure Prediction
This is a simple machine learning project that tries to predict whether a heart failure patient might survive or not based on their medical details.
It’s made using Python and Jupyter Notebook, so you can see the whole process step-by-step.

📂 What’s in the Dataset?
The dataset contains real-world medical records of 299 patients.
Some of the details it includes are:

Age – How old the patient is

Anaemia – Low red blood cells or not

Blood Pressure – High BP or not

Creatinine Level – Kidney function

Ejection Fraction – How well the heart pumps blood

Follow-up Time – How long the patient was tracked

Death Event – 1 if the patient died during the follow-up, 0 if not

🔍 What the Project Does
Loads and understands the dataset

Cleans the data (removes errors/missing info)

Builds machine learning models to make predictions

Checks which model works best

Shows results with simple charts

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
Python

pandas, numpy – For handling data

matplotlib, seaborn – For graphs

scikit-learn – For machine learning models

📊 What You’ll Get
Data visualizations (graphs & charts)

Prediction accuracy for different models

Insights into which features affect survival the most
